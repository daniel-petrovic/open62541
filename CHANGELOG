 * LocaleId support in the server

   The server now supports that descriptions and display names for
   different locales are written to a node. The server selects a
   suitable localization depending on the locale ids that are set for
   the current session.

   Locales are added simply by writing a LocalizedText value with a
   different locale. A locale can be removed by writing a
   LocalizedText value of the corresponding locale and with an empty
   text.

   The change was done with pull request #4165.

 * Server port and hostname configuration

   Instead of configuring the port number in the server's
   "NetworkLayer", the server configuration now takes a list of
   ServerURLs like `opc.tcp://my-server:4840` or
   `opc.wss://localhost:443`. The URLs are used both for discovery
   and to set up the server sockets based on the defined hostnames
   (and ports).

   The default is to listen on all interfaces with port 4840 for
   incoming TCP connections.

 * Empty arrays always match the array dimensions

   We consider empty arrays (also null-arrays) to have implied array
   dimensions [0,0,...]. So they always match the array dimensions
   defined in the variable. With this, the initialization of
   variables without a defined value has been simplified.
   We now create a null array if one is required.
